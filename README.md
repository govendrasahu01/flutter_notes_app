# Flutter Notes App

This is my first Flutter app — a simple **Notes application** built using **Flutter** and **SQLite**.

## ✨ Features

- Add, edit, and delete notes (CRUD operations)
- Local storage using `sqflite` package
- Clean UI with `StatefulWidget`-based state management

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

- **Flutter**
- **SQLite** (via `sqflite`)
- **Stateful Widgets** for logic handling

## 🚀 What's Next

I’m currently learning advanced Flutter concepts. In my upcoming apps, I will be implementing **global state management** using:
- `provider`
- `bloc / cubit`
- `riverpod`
- `getx`

Stay tuned for more projects and improvements!
